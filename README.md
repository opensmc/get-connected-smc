# Introduction
Get Connected SMC helps San Mateo County residents understand what assistance programs they may be eligible for. The concept is to combine the ease of use of [Get CalFresh](https://getcalfresh.org/) with the power of the directory information found in [SMC Connect](https://www.smc-connect.org/).

Here's an example of a commercial product we could use as a model: https://www.mrelief.com/#?category=All

# Access to Food
The first service area will be access to food. We will incorporate WIC, County food banks, and schools for referrals.

## Requirements from County Human Services Agency (HSA)
>On the front end ask for family size, income, then ask if they are kids under 5 for WIC and maybe older adults for Meals On Wheels and then if someone doesn't qualify for anything of the federal programs, then we can direct them to the 8 CORE agencies and Food Bank
and also suggest to parents that they can ask their schools for free and reduced meals

## Determining eligibility

From State Department of Public Health (CDPH)

* ACS data were used to determine WIC eligibility among children < 5 years of age.
* Children were categorized as:
  ** Income Eligible if they were living in families with total household income less than or equal to 185% FPL
  ** Adjunctively Eligible if they had income higher than 185% FPL, or were missing income information, and participated in CalFresh or were covered by Medi-Cal insurance during the past 12 months.
* Ineligible if they did not meet the criteria for income or adjunctive eligibility.
* Current federal poverty level numbers: https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/news/july16/FPG.htm
